#2D JavaGame
#Luffy's Adventure.
In this 2D Java game, you embark on a treasure hunt deep in the forest. Armed with keyboard controls, guide your adventurer around the screen using W(up), A(left), S(down), and D(right). Your quest involves collecting three scattered keys and picking random speed and slow potions.  With keys in hand, unlock the three mysterious doors to finally reach the hidden treasure! Remember, no key, no entry! So get exploring, adventurer!

Steps of the Game:
* Start your adventure in the heart of the forest, adventurer! Your journey begins standing tall at the center of the screen.
* Master the forest paths! Use your trusty keyboard – W, A, S, and D – to navigate around the screen and explore every nook and cranny.
* Keep your eyes peeled for three hidden keys tucked away in the forest depths. Collecting all three is your key to unlocking ancient secrets!
* Don't underestimate the power of potions! Find the legendary potions and watch your adventurer zip through the forest with newfound speed and slow.
* Remember those keys? Once you've gathered all three, they become your passport to unlocking the three mysterious doors scattered around the screen. No key, no entry!
* Finally, with doors unlocked and your heart pounding with anticipation, step into the unknown and claim the legendary treasure that awaits!

This is a very challenging task and there are some part that is not mine and some parts are modified and implemented by me. I watched Mr. RyiSnow's tutorial for my project and I used some of his codes. I implemented some sound effects for this game and the other sound is from Mr. RyiSnow.
